	"aboutTheVanliferSecond": "In 2021 my partner and I decided to set off on a European adventure, the idea was that we would be out on a trip to Spain and Portugal for six months with our campervan. Only a couple months into the trip we felt that it really was something we liked and now we are here 3 years later and we cancelled the lease on our apartment. We have been everywhere from the mountains in Scotland to the Sunsoaked beaches of Greece. ",
